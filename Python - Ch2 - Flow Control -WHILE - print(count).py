# Python While Loop - Incrementing a Count Variable Lab - Scratch Pad
# Use this Replit to try some code... Use it as a scratch pad.

'''
Coding Challenge:
While Loop - Print A Count Value - This Challenge is to write 
code that uses a while loop to print the value of a counter 
variable that starts at 0 and loops up to 10.  It should 
print 0-9 and then on the tenth test quit out of the loop.

Expected Output:

  Starting While Loop - Print Count Variable
  0
  1
  2
  â€¦
  8
  9
  Ending While Loop
